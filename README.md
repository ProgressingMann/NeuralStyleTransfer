# NeuralStyleTransfer
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is based on Convolutional Neural Networks to compose one image with the style of another image.

Images folder contains the content and style images.
Output folder contains the image generated by the neural style transfer model.
NeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb contains implementation of NST.
VGG16model.h5 contains the VGG16 model from keras package, used by transfer learning and trained on imagenet dataset.
We use this model's hidden and input layers and top them with our custom layers to construct a new Neural Network capable of generating a new image.
